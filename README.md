# KK_Ahegao
This plugin adds ahegao to Koikatsu H-scenes.

Requires [BepInEx 5.3](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases).

### Installation
Download the latest .zip from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Kokaiinum/KK_Ahegao/releases) and extract it into your game folder.

## Usage
By default, the ahegao state is triggered once 3 orgasms have occured and the speed is above 50%. Both the speed check and the orgasm count can be configured in the plugin settings.

When ahegao state is reached, the character's face will switch into the expressions set in the options.
For the expressions with number entries, the number corresponds to the expression's place in the list as seen in the creator/studio - for example, the expression at 0 is the default expression in the creator, the expression at 1 is the second expression, etc.

All of the individual options can be disabled or enabled to your liking.

## Credits
